# Gif-Chat is a chat application running on a flask backend. It uses websockets and API calls to the backend to update the chat in real time amongst multiple users.

This chat application inserts a contextual GIF inline with your messages, powered by the GIPHY API.

I hope that it proves fun. https://gif-chat.appspot.com/
